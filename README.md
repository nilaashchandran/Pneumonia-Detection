<h1>Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classifier</h1>
This project uses deep learning to classify chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia using the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect signs of pneumonia in medical scans, aiding early diagnosis.

Key Features:
1.Image preprocessing and augmentation
2.CNN model for binary classification
3.Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
